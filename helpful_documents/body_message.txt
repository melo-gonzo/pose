You're one of the first users of Angle Eye AI! I'm trying to draw a stick figure on you using artificial intelligence. This works by identifying key joints in your body like your elbows, knees, shoulders and ankles. Using this information, some joint-angles are calculated which tell you how certain limbs are positioned relative to one another. You can use this information to analyze your form for: running, lifting, cycling, and more! Check out the attached quick start guide for information on how you can utilize this interface and get the best results possible.

The results from your image are also attached. Enjoy the data!

Note that due to attachment size limits, we cannot process and send videos for you at this time. If you want to analyze a video, you can still send it and give us a specific request to upload a google drive link to the results


Best,
AngleEyeAI
